            <h4> Hello Class! My name is Pamela Rodriguez and I am a junior here at Cal State San Bernardino. I am currently a computer science major with a vocational license in nursing. I hope to be able to merge both degrees to change lives and make an impact. So far I have one son and three dogs. A golden doodle, a pug, and a german shepherd mix. On my free time I like to play basketball, run, play guitar, or code. A fun fact about me is that I love visiting any building that has to do with chocolate; may it be factories, museums, or stores.  </h4>

            <div class="paragraph">
         My schooling has actually been through the course of about 10 years. At the beginning when I was 18 I was not too focused. Yet I still pursued certifications such as dental assistant and nursing assistant to help pay for my schooling. At the age of 23 I decided to get my nursing license, and three years later I started a new journey working on my computer science degree.
